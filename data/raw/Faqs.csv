Enviromental Issues,Do cellular phone towers cause cancer?,"The consensus of the international scientific community is that the power from mobile phone base station antennae is far too low to produce health hazards.

Nothing has been proven negative so far despite the extensive amount of research made around the subject.

It is essential however for people to keep their distance from the base station antennae and not the structures supporting them."
Enviromental Issues,Are there any damaging health hazards from mobile phone waves?,"Mobile phone networks operate using electromagnetic waves within the non-ionizing radiation range which is scientifically acknowledged as not causing harmful biological effect on human beings.

This fact is confirmed by all international specialized organization, most importantly is the World Health Organization [WHO]; which announced that there is no proof of any harmful effects on human health due to the use of mobile phone or being around or below mobile network base stations."
Enviromental Issues,Do mobile phones affect fertility rates or does it cause sterility?,Sterility cases were never reported as a result of using mobile phones or living near base stations' antennae. Medical reports that indicated a link between m​icrowaves and a decrease in fertility were about some soldiers subjected to large doses of radar waves for long durations.
Enviromental Issues,Do cellular phone towers cause any other health problems?,"While high levels of radiofrequency waves can cause warming of tissues, cellular phone towers do not yield exposure at levels sufficient to cause this effect. There is no evidence in any published scientific report that cell phone towers cause any other health problems.

The world health organization has stated that there are soundly based, clearly established guidelines for human exposure to EMF. It further stated that: 'for most of us, exposure to EMF is well below these guideline levels. No adverse effect was found in people exposed to everyday background levels'."
Enviromental Issues,What about the negative health reports that were published by some Egyptian and international newspapers?,"According to most international institutions, no one was able prove such effects in an independent laboratory. There were experiments made on rats but the same results cannot be applied to human beings due to major differences in the response of the human body to electro magnetic waves. Furthermore, experiments on rates used extremely high dosages and for long periods of time."
Enviromental Issues,Which is more powerful? Mobile handsets or radio base stations?,"The power from most radio base stations is greater than that of a mobile phone handset; however exposure from a handset is inevitably higher due to the person's close proximity to it.
"
Enviromental Issues,Why are people asked to switch off their mobile at gas stations?,Basically to avoid electromagnetic interferences with gas meters due to the energy emitte​d by mobile phones during operation.
Enviromental Issues,Does medical hearing aids or pace maker get affected with mobile phone?,"When mobile phones are used close to medical devices [like pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and certain hearing aids] there is a possibility that it would cause interference.

People using such medical devices should read their manuals and familiarize themselves with any precautions required."
Enviromental Issues,What are the global recommendations for base stations and mobile phone safe usage?,"Rationalize mobile phone use by pregnant women.
Restrict newly born babies from playing with handsets or putting its antennae in mouth or ears.
Make sure that ​children use their mobile phones in a proper way.
Minimize phone call durations.
Maintain a distance buffer around the base station antennae: Six meters in the direction facing the antennae and two meters from the sides and back."
Enviromental Issues,Are there any health risks caused by the installation of a cellular tower in the immediate area?,"No, The radiation level at the ground is usually thousands of times less than safety limits. There is no reason to believe that such towers can pose a potential health hazard to residents.

​"
Enviromental Issues,What do I do if I’ve been exposed to cellular phone towers?,"As previously mentioned, cell phone towers pose little risk under ordinary conditions. However, if there is a cellular phone tower mounted near your home or office, you can ask a government agency to measure the radiofrequency field strength near the tower to ensure that it is within the acceptable range."
Enviromental Issues,Why can't the base stations be built away from residential area?,Because both the mobile phone and base station operates at low power level. The base station needs to be close to the area where people wish to use mobile phones​.
Enviromental Issues,Does the presence of a base station on top of a building create reason to worry for the residents of that building?,"No. Since the antennae emit electromagnetic waves in horizontal directions only; the least affected persons by radiation are those who are actually living inside the building in question.

Moreover, the concrete roofs on top of the buildings on which the antennae are mounted absorb most the waves that may reach them.

​"
Enviromental Issues,Will Orange look at every base station in the country?,"Yes, Orange has a specialized team working under the supervision of The National Telecommunication Regulatory Authority [NTRA] to measure sites and ensure their compliance to national and International standards. The measurements are made according to a set yearly plan; any non-conformances are corrected immediately."
Enviromental Issues,Is there any government supervision exercised on mobile phone networks?,"Yes, there is strict supervision from various government entities on mobile networks as is the case for all communication bodies and networks in Egypt.

The National Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (NTRA) is responsible for reviewing all network components prior to issuing their licenses. It is also responsible for issuing protocols for installation of mobile network base stations anywhere in the nation as well as conducting measurement checks on existing base stations to ensure their compliance.

The Ministry of health is also involved in dictating health conditions to ensure safety of human beings around or below mobile base stations on a regular basis. The Ministry of the Environment sets environmental conditions for all base stations whether previously or currently installed and offers a licensing procedure for them.

It is worth noting that all measurements made on base station antennae radiation are often much lower than the permissible national and international limits of [0.4 MW/ cm2]."
Enviromental Issues,So why worry?,"Due to the heavy presence of base stations mostly through urban areas, some degree of concern is expected; especially at the infancy of this technology.

We expect that after some time; people will be accustomed to its presence and we are confident that the government will continue its supervisory role to ensure safety of its citizens.
